      "Michael Jordan earned the nickname 'Black Cat' for his superior athletic ability and prowess at both ends of the court. That nickname became the muse for the Tinker Hatfield-designed Air Jordan 13. Featuring a panther-paw-like sole and 'cat eye' holograph, Michael rode the mid-top shoe all the way to his 6th ring-3 in '98, the last triumph of his legendary career. The Air Jordan 13 Retro brings back the stealthy, shrouded design with a fresh mix of colours and textures.",
