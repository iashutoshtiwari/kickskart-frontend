## 🌱 Environment Setup

KickSkart uses environment variables for API integration and deployment flexibility.

### 🔐 Environment Files

- `.env.local` — for local development (ignored by Git)
- `.env.production` — for production (handled by Vercel, also ignored)
- `.env.example` — Use it as a reference/template.

### 🧪 How to Set Up Locally

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```
